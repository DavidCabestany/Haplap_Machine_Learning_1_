# Introduction to Machine Learning in NLP - My Solutions

Welcome to the "Introduction to Machine Learning in NLP" repository! This repository contains my solutions to the assignments and practical tasks from the course on basic statistical principles and techniques used in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a focus on machine learning.

## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to the fundamental statistical principles and techniques relevant to NLP. We cover various aspects of descriptive statistics and introduce essential machine learning techniques for processing natural language data. The course includes basic data preprocessing steps and explores the main learning algorithms commonly used in NLP tasks.

## Syllabus

The course covers the following topics:

1. **Basic Statistical Measures**: Understanding key statistical measures, such as mean, standard deviation, chi-square, mutual information, kappa, and more, essential for analyzing NLP data.

2. **Introduction to Machine Learning in NLP**: An overview of how Artificial Intelligence is applied in the field of NLP, with an emphasis on machine learning approaches.

3. **Basic Machine Learning Algorithms**: Exploring fundamental machine learning algorithms applicable to NLP, including Naive Bayes, K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbors), Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

4. **Evaluation in Supervised Learning**: Understanding evaluation metrics for supervised learning tasks, ensuring accurate assessment of model performance.

## Assignments

In this repository, you will find **my solutions** to the assignments and practical tasks given during the course. Each assignment is organized into separate directories, and the solutions are provided in the form of code, notebooks, or reports, as applicable.

## Note

These solutions are **my own work**, intended to serve as references and examples for fellow students. If you are currently enrolled in the same course, I encourage you to attempt the assignments independently before referring to these solutions.

## Disclaimer

While these solutions can aid your understanding of machine learning concepts in NLP, please refrain from submitting them as your own work for grading purposes. Upholding academic integrity is of utmost importance.
